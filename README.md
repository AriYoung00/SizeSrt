# SizeSrt
List dir contents by size

## Usage
This program is so simple that I'm really writing this for fun.
`python3 sizesrt.py [directory]`
If you provide no directory argument, `sizesrt` just runs in the current working directory. Betcha didn't see that one coming.

If the desire so strikes you, you can remove the .py extension, `chmod +x` this, and place it in your /usr/local/bin directory, so that you can run it from wherever. Or not. I won't tell you how to live 
your life.

Don't run it with python 2. Trust me.
